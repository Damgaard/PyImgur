Changelog
=========

This is the changelog for the released versions of PyImgur. These changes are
divided into four categories.

 * **[FEATURE]** Something new has been added.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Something was broken before, but is now fixed.
 * **[IMGUR]** A change caused by an upstream change from Imgur.
 * **[CHANGE]** Other changes affecting user programs, such as the renaming of
   a function.

PyImgur 0.7.1
----------
 * **[FEATURE]** get_favorites and get_gallery_favorites now supports pagination.
 * **[FEATURE]** get_gallery_favorites now supports sorting by oldest and newest.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix an issue with pagination, where the limit argument would
    be ignored and maximum content would always be fetched. Correct data would
    be fetched, but the number of requests would be excessive.
 * **[CHANGE]** Reverted changes in 0.7.0 that set some non-default configurations
    for pylint, pytest and black.

PyImgur 0.7.0
-------------

 * **[CHANGE]** Dropped support for Python 2.7. Lowest supported version is now
   Python 3.9.
 * **[CHANGE]** Added PYIMGUR_TIMEOUT environment variable to set the timeout
   for requests. Defaults to 30 seconds.
 * **[CHANGE]** Added PYIMGUR_VERIFY_SSL environment variable to set whether
   IMGUR's SSL certificates should be verified. Defaults to True. Note that
   this is a _breaking_ change as the Imgur object no longer accepts a verify
   argument.
 * **[IMGUR]** Fixed a large amount of broken calls due to backwards incompatible
   changes in the Imgur API. üôè Thanks to me for having written a decent amount
   of tests in the past, making it possible to catch and fix these issues.
   Some issues may persist. The intent of this release is to get out a minimal
   version, that works and is of acceptable quality. It is still thought, quite
   a large release with breaking changes.

PyImgur 0.6.0
-------------

 * **[FEATURE]** Increase python 3.x compatibility. PyImgur is still only
   officially compatible with python 2.7.
 * **[FEATURE]** Add support for Mashape API Keys for commercial usage of the
   Imgur API. See: http://api.imgur.com/#commercial
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix a crash that would occur when trying to use the
   method :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.User.get_favorites`.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix a crash that would occur when trying to use the
   method :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.User.get_notifications`.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fixed a bug where accessing a non-existing attribute on a
   object inheriting from Basic_object would throw a `IndexError` rather
   than the expected `AttributeError`.
 * **[CHANGE]** Tests that require authentication will now be skipped if
   authentication has not been set up.

PyImgur 0.5.3
-------------

 * **[FEATURE]** Make it possible to skip SSL certificate verification.
 * **[FEATURE]** Increase python 2.6 compatibility. PyImgur is still only
   officially compatible with python 2.7.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix missing `has_fetched` arguments breaking :meth:`.get_subreddit_gallery`.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix bug breaking :meth:`.get_gallery` from working.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix incorrect argument that prevented :meth:`.exchange_code`
   from working.

PyImgur 0.5.2
-------------

 * **[BUGFIX]** Fixed an installation crash that happened if the `requests`
   dependency wasn't already installed.

PyImgur 0.5.1
-------------

 * **[BUGFIX]** Fix bug in :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Album.update` that caused
   it to crash when calling it with a list of image ids as the images argument.
   A bug also prevented the cover argument from being a Image object as is
   possible elsewhere, instead it could only be the id of an image.
 * **[BUGFIX]** If an album had no cover Image, then before it would create a
   lazy Image object for the cover with ``None`` as Id. Now the ``cover``
   attribute will correctly be ``None``.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Only albums instantiated with
   :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.get_album` starts with the ``images``
   attribute set. Now ``_has_fetched`` has been set to ``False`` for such
   albums. Meaning that a call to ``Album.images`` will refresh the object and
   it will then have the ``images`` attribute set.

PyImgur 0.5
-----------

 * **[FEATURE]** Add :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.get_at_url` that takes an
   url and returns an object matching what is located at the url.
 * **[FEATURE]** Add :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.get_memes_gallery` that
   return the gallery of memes as on `the webend <http://imgur.com/g/memes>`_.
 * **[FEATURE]** Add :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.get_subreddit_image` that
   can return a subreddit image.
 * **[IMGUR]** Imgur changed their API to return more data in the response,
   when uploading an image. But the variables that could be sent were always
   ``None`` in the response. See `the bug report to Imgur
   <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/imgur/F3uVb55TMGo>`_
 * **[BUGFIX]** If :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Image.download` was used with an
   invalid filename given as the ``name`` argument or an invalid filename was
   gotten via the title, then the download would fail with an IOError. It now
   defaults to saving it with the hash as the name if the primary choice is an
   invalid filename.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Manually calling :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Basic_object.refresh`
   didn't update the value of ``_has_fetched``.

PyImgur 0.4.2
-------------

 * **[FEATURE]** :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.upload_image` can now upload
   images given with a url as well as being able to upload images given with a
   path. Either a path or a url to an image must be given when calling
   :meth:`~pyimgur.__init__.Imgur.upload_image`.

PyImgur 0.4.1
-------------

 * **[FEATURE]** Instead of returning an error, PyImgur will now resend
   requests to Imgur if it's expected that the second request will be
   successful.  This is for the cases where Imgur has an internal error or the
   returned data is malformed.
 * **[BUGFIX]** Fixed that User.get_images() unnecessarily required
   authentication as a user.

PyImgur 0.4.0
-------------

 * **[CHANGE]** This version was a complete overhaul of PyImgur. It updated the
   version of Imgurs API PyImgur used to version 3.0 and implemented almost all
   functionality exposed. Additionally PyImgur changed from functional code to
   object oriented code.
